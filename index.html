          Welcome to my <strong>DataStory!</strong> This website is the culmination of several small data projects throughout the semester, including the Data Collection, the Data Visualization, and the Explained Video. Each section is explained down below, but feel free to click on the links to get to each section. Enjoy!

          <p> <strong>The Data Collection</strong> was the first project we worked on this semester. It involved deciding what kind of data I wanted to collect, what I needed to include, and how I wanted to set up my collection log, along with the actual collection of the data. I decided to collect data about how I use my phone. I collected information on what type of apps I use, the duration I use them for, and the time of day they're being used. I also decided to track whether or not I got a notification with each instance of use, and whether or not I was procrastinating. What came of it is several days filled with data about the ways I used my phone. I was surprised to see how my phone use changed throughout the week, and how I use my phone the majority of the time. Look at all that data!

          <p><strong>The Data Visualization</strong> is what I imagine as the baby of data and imaging. I was inspired by the Dear Data project that we looked at early in the semester to do something that is fairly readable, but also has some color. I enjoy things like line symmetry and balance in visuals, so my final visual product came from those ideas. The time runs downward and vertical, and each usage is divided by app type and level of engagement, which are marked by color and the shade of each color, respectively. This data is much easier to read now that it's been tucked into a visual!</p>

        <div id="explainedvideoinfo">
          <p> <strong>The Explained Video</strong> that my group and I worked on was designed to educate about the use of algorithms in the healthcare industry. We wanted to highlight the issues surrounding healthcare itself, along with how algorithms have changed the industry. This is the product of several weeks of research and practice to build up each piece of the video, as well as a lot of teamwork. We all contributed equally, each doing a part that was our respective strong suit, and that suited our video best. I hope you enjoy learning as much about the healthcare system as we did!

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This semester's projects have taught me a lot about the ways that technology can benefit us by learning about my technological habits, and learning how to create an image displaying those habits. I've also seen the ways in which technology can cause issues through the research for the Explained Video. I've learned more about how to use different aspects of technology than I thought I could, including basics like spreadsheets, and more complex items, like Inkscape and introductory coding. It was a tough road, but I stuck to it, and I made it here. Thanks for reading!</p>
